Analysis of Churn Rate in Telecom Company
A crucial indicator of client happiness is the churn rate. When churn rates are low, customers are content; when they are high, customers are defecting. Forbes claims that acquiring new clients is five times more expensive for a corporation than maintaining current ones. Because it shows us how many current customers are leaving the company, reducing churn has a hugely positive influence on revenue streams.

In the telecommunications sector (wireless and cable service providers, satellite television providers, internet service providers, etc.), the churn rate is crucial because it reveals the quality of the company, demonstrates customer satisfaction with the good or service, and enables comparison with rivals to determine an acceptable level of churn. In order to anticipate the customer churn rate, we will examine customer data from a telecoms business, Telco.

The goal of the business is to develop classification models that can predict the probability of customer attrition. By doing this, we may ascertain whether the client plans to remain with the company or not. The 'churn' variable found in the dataset is the one we are attempting to predict.
